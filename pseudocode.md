<!-- This a a pseudo code to help write the password generator code
Objective:
to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Requirements

 * Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
      -To Do - Add validation alert for length
     

    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
       
Get user to select option from prompt to choose option
 * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
       
/* My psuedo code
Include length check is between 8 to 128 in user choice
if(choice===lowerCase)
pick random from lowerCasedCharacters
concatenate the password with the type
check if user chose any of the below character options and concatenate for each

if (choice===upperCase)
pick random from upperCasedCharacters

if (choice===numeric)
pick random from numericCharacters

if (choice===special)
pick random from numericCharacters

for loop this code to the length chosen by the user
The generate window should display the password
